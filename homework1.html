    I'm not good enough.This type of negative thought that can apply to many categories.Maybe you don't think you're a good enough mother or good at a sport.Even if you find yourself lacking in something, there's no need to keep repeating it to yourself. The human brain is an incredible thing. Be inspired by Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor, Harvard-trained neuroscientist who suffered a stroke that left her unable to walk, read, write, talk, or remember her previous life. Dr. Taylor took eight years to recover and has since then written a best-selling book about her experience and appeared on Oprah. Keep on working toward something, and watch the leaps and bounds you'll make.
