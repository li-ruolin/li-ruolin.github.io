          ..........  There are moments in life when you miss someone so much that you just want to pick 
<br>  ..........   them from your dreams and hug them for real! Dream what you want to dream;
<br>  ..........   go where you want to go;be what you want to be,because you have only one 
<br>  ..........   life and one chance to do all the things you want to do.
 </p >
        <p>
          ..........  May you have enough happiness to make you sweet,enough trials to make you strong,
<br>  ..........   enough sorrow to keep you human,enough hope to make you happy? Always put 
<br>  ..........   yourself in others’shoes.If you feel that it hurts you,it probably hurts the other 
<br>  ..........   person, too.

        <p> 
          ..........  The happiest of people don’t necessarily have the best of everything;they just make
<br>  ..........   the most of everything that comes along their way.Happiness lies for those who cry,
<br>  ..........   those who hurt, those who have searched,and those who have tried,for only they 
<br>  ..........   can appreciate the importance of people who have touched their lives.Love begins 
<br>  ..........   with a smile,grows with a kiss and ends with a tear.The brightest future will always 
<br>  ..........   be based on a forgotten past, you can’t go on well in lifeuntil you let go of your 
<br>  ..........   past failures and heartaches.
        </p >
        <p>     
           ..........  When you were born,you were crying and everyone around you was smiling.Live 
<br>  ..........   your life so that when you die,you're the one who is smiling and everyone around 
<br>  ..........   you is crying.
        </p >
        <p>     
           ..........  Please send this message to those people who mean something to you,to those 
<br>  ..........   who have touched your life in one way or another,to those who make you smile 
<br>  ..........   when you really need it,to those that make you see the brighter side of things 
<br>  ..........   when you are really down,to those who you want to let them know that you 
<br>  ..........   appreciate their friendship.And if you don’t, don’t worry,nothing bad will 
<br>  ..........   happen to you,you will just miss out on the opportunity to brighten 
<br>  ..........   someone’s day with this message.
