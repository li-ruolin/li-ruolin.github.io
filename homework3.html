    <p> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are moments in life when you miss someone so much that you just want to pick 
them from your dreams and hug them for real! Dream what you want to dream;
<br>go where you want to go;be what you want to be,because you have only one 
life and one chance to do all the things you want to do.
 </p >
        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  May you have enough happiness to make you sweet,enough trials to make you strong,
 enough sorrow to keep you human,enough hope to make you happy? Always put 
 yourself in others’shoes.If you feel that it hurts you,it probably hurts the other 
 person, too.

        <p> 
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The happiest of people don’t necessarily have the best of everything;they just make
 the most of everything that comes along their way.Happiness lies for those who cry,
  those who hurt, those who have searched,and those who have tried,for only they 
  can appreciate the importance of people who have touched their lives.Love begins 
with a smile,grows with a kiss and ends with a tear.The brightest future will always 
 be based on a forgotten past, you can’t go on well in lifeuntil you let go of your past failures and heartaches.
